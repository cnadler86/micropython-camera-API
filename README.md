# Camera API for micropython

[![ESP32 Port](https://github.com/cnadler86/micropython-camera-API/actions/workflows/ESP32.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cnadler86/micropython-camera-API/actions/workflows/ESP32.yml)

This project aims to support cameras in different ports in micropython, starting with the ESP32-Port and omnivision (OV2640 & OV5640) cameras. The project implements a general API for cameras in micropython (such as circuitpython have done).
At the moment, this is a micropython user module, but it might get in the micropython repo in the future.
The API is stable, but it might change without previous anounce.

## Precomiled FW (the easy way)

If you are not familiar with building a custom firmware, you can go to the [releases](https://github.com/cnadler86/micropython-camera-API/releases) page and download one of the generic FWs that suits your board.

## Using the API

```python
from camera import Camera, GrabMode, PixelFormat, FrameSize, GainCeiling

# Camera construction and initialization
# These pins are just examples and if you use them just like that will get a watchdog error. Adapt them to your board!
camera = Camera(
    data_pins=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],
    vsync_pin=9,
    href_pin=10,
    sda_pin=11,
    scl_pin=12,
    pclk_pin=13,
    xclk_pin=14,
    xclk_freq=20000000,
    powerdown_pin=-1,
    reset_pin=-1,
    pixel_format=PixelFormat.RGB565,
    frame_size=FrameSize.QVGA,
    jpeg_quality=15,
    fb_count=1,
    grab_mode=GrabMode.WHEN_EMPTY
)

#Camera construction using defaults (if you specified them in mpconfigboard.h)
camera = Camera()

# Capture image
img = camera.capture()

# Camera reconfiguration 
camera.reconfigure(pixel_format=PixelFormat.JPEG,frame_size=FrameSize.QVGA,grab_mode=GrabMode.LATEST, fb_count=2)
camera.set_quality(10)
```

You can get and set sensor properties by the respective methods (e.g. camera.get_brightness() or camera.set_vflip(True). See autocompletitions in Thonny in order to see the list of methods.
If you want more insides in the methods and what they actually do, you can find a very good documentation [here](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/espcamera/index.html).
Notice that for the methods in here you need to prefix a get/set, depending on what you want to do.

## Build your custom FW

### Setup build environment (the DIY way)

To build the project, follow the following instructions:

- [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.2.3/esp32/get-started/index.html): I used version 5.2.3, but it might work with other versions (see notes).
- Clone the micropython repo and this repo in a folder, e.g. "MyESPCam". I used the actual micropython master branch (between v1.23 and before 1.24).
- You will have to add the ESP32-Camera driver (I used v2.0.12). To do this, add the following to the respective idf_component.yml file  (e.g. in micropython/ports/esp32/main_esp32s3/idf_component.yml):

```yml
  espressif/esp32-camera:
    git: https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera
```

Alternatively, you can clone the <https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera> repository inside the esp-idf/components folder instead of altering the idf_component.yml file.

### Add camera configurations to your board (Optional, but recommended)

To make things easier, add the following lines to your board config-file "mpconfigboard.h" with the respective pins and camera parameters. Otherwise, you will need to pass all parameters during construction.
Don't forget the empty line at the bottom.
Example for Xiao sense:

```c
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_D0       (15)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_D1       (17)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_D2       (18)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_D3       (16)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_D4       (14)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_D5       (12)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_D6       (11)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_D7       (48)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_PCLK     (13)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_VSYNC    (38)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_HREF     (47)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_XCLK     (10)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_PWDN     (-1)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_RESET    (-1)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_SIOD     (40)  // SDA
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_PIN_SIOC     (39)  // SCL
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_XCLK_FREQ    (20000000)  // Frequencies are normally either 10 MHz or 20 MHz
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_FB_COUNT     (2)   // Usually the value is between 1 (slow) and 2 (fast, but more load on CPU)
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_JPEG_QUALITY (10)  // Quality of JPEG output. 0-63 lower means higher quality. Definition will change in the future
#define MICROPY_CAMERA_GRAB_MODE    (1)   // 0=WHEN_EMPTY (might have old data, but less resources), 1=LATEST (best, but more resources)

```

### Build the API

To build the project, you could do it the following way:

```bash
. <path2esp-idf>/esp-idf/export.sh
cd MyESPCam/micropython/ports/esp32
make USER_C_MODULES=../../../../micropython-camera-API/src/micropython.cmake BOARD=<Your-Board> clean
make USER_C_MODULES=../../../../micropython-camera-API/src/micropython.cmake BOARD=<Your-Board> submodules
make USER_C_MODULES=../../../../micropython-camera-API/src/micropython.cmake BOARD=<Your-Board> all
```

If you experience problems, visit [MicroPython external C modules](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/cmodules.html).
## Notes

- The OV5640 pinout is compatible with boards designed for the OV2640 but the voltage supply is too high for the internal 1.5V regulator, so the camera overheats unless a heat sink is applied. For recording purposes the OV5640 should only be used with an ESP32S3 board. Frame sizes above FHD framesize should only be used for still images due to memory limitations.
- If your target board is a ESP32, I recommend using IDF >= 5.2, since older versions may lead to IRAM overflow during build. Alternatively you can modify your sdkconfig-file (see [issue #1](https://github.com/cnadler86/micropython-camera-API/issues/1)).

## Plans for the future
- [ ] imolrment structure in repo to include other boards like xiao sense
- [ ] harmonize properties to standard ones at API level, e.g. jpeg quality to the range 100=very good, 1/0= very bad
- [ ] edge case: enable usage of pins such as i2c for other applications
- [ ] provide examples in binary image with lfs-merge
